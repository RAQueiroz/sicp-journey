# My SICP Journey

I'll read the classic book [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). But I'm starting with [Simply Scheme](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html) by Harvey and Wright.

## Setup

I'm using tha Racket language with the following packages:

1. [SICP 'Language'](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/Contributors.html)
2. [Simply Scheme](https://docs.racket-lang.org/manual@simply-scheme/index.html)
3. [Programs](ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/scheme)
